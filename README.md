about task 4 actually for me (a little bit experienced those packages)
i think those code are clear and really step by step (even that i want to skip part of code)
just someone who don't have experience about those packages maybe need some time to understand those code

so mix those things i talk about (for someone experienced and not) i think those code are good enough
